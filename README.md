  Our team: Andriy Bondar(Product Owner), Arthur Weimholt, Harmeet Sohal, Nathanael Chow, and Shiyuan Huang

  A lot of students have a hard time meeting with counselors and it could sometimes take weeks to hear back from them.

  This ends up leaving students trying to figure out what classes they need to take for graduation and that can be a lot of piecing together for the students. Our app would automate this process and help students figure out schedules personalized for them.

  Sprint's plans and reports are in ['Documents'](https://github.com/abondar777/BSOECourseSchedulingApp/tree/main/Documents) folder. The final release codes are in ['Final_Release'](https://github.com/abondar777/BSOECourseSchedulingApp/tree/main/Final_Release) folder. Old version of codes are in ['Outdated Code'](https://github.com/abondar777/BSOECourseSchedulingApp/tree/main/Outdated%20Code) folder. Test files are in ['Test'](https://github.com/abondar777/BSOECourseSchedulingApp/tree/main/Test) folder.
