      </h1>
      <p>
        We are team "BSOE Course Scheduler".
        Our team members include Andriy Bondar(Product Owner), Harmeet Sohal, Nathanael Chow, Arthur Weimholt, and Shiyuan Huang.
        <br>Our story: A lot of students have a hard time meeting with counselors and it could sometimes take weeks to hear back from them.<br>
        This ends up leaving students trying to figure out what classes they need to take for graduation and that can be a lot of piecing together for the students. <br>
        Our app would automate this process and help students figure out schedules personalized for them.
